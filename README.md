# Perio Plan 

## Description: 

This repository is a proof of concept for a project called Perio Plan - a data driven platform to augment the diagnosis process for periodontal disease. The app has a simple front end, and allows the user to manipulate several parameters used to diagnose perioidontal disease on a tooth by tooth basis. The prediction is displayed, along with the associated probabilities of each stage of periodontal disease. 

*NOTE* The machine learning model is trained on synthetic data, and is not representative of true periodontal disease diagnosis. 

## Stack: 

The app is written in Python. The front end was developed using Streamlit, and the underlying machine learning model was implemented in scikit-learn. 

## Accessing the app: 

The app is accessible [here](https://share.streamlit.io/tim-r-cruz/perio-plan/main.py).
